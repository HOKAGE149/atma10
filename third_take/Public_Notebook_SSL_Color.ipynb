議論と考察\n","\n","ここでは上の実験に関していくつか改善できる点をあげたり、どのような学習がなされていそうかといった考察を行います。\n","\n","まず、上の実装に関してですがいくつか問題があります(私が実際サブミットに使ったものと一貫性を取りたかったためあえてそのままにしています)。\n","\n","* 上の実装ではKFoldでFoldを切って学習をしているがこれをやらない方がいい可能性がある\n","\n","わざわざKFoldを切って学習をしているのですが、これはうっかり惰性でやってしまっただけで本来必要はありません。というかおそらくやってしまうとあまり良くありません。なぜかというと、各foldで学習されたモデルはそれぞれ**違う特徴空間への射影を学習している**ため、後で特徴として利用しようとするときには5つの異なる特徴空間を無理やりくっつけたような特徴空間になってしまうからです。当然異なる特徴空間どうしでは近いか遠いかを区別できないため問題が生じます。解決策としてはKFoldを切らず、全データを用いて学習をする、ということが挙げられます。今回は特にターゲットの値を使って学習をしているわけではないのでリークの心配はありません。\n","\n","* 最終層がReLU()をかけた出力になっている\n","\n","得られた特徴表現が非常にスパースになっていることに気づいた方も多いかと思いますが、これは私がうっかりReLU()の出力を出してしまっていて負値を全て0にしてしまっているからです。これもうっかりミスでやってしまっているので直した方がいいかもしれません。\n","\n","以上の2点が実装上のミスで出てしまっている問題点のため、直すことで改善が見込めるかもしれません。\n","\n","\n","また、上記の学習プロセスで何を学習させているのか、ということを考察すると、改善の余地が見つかるかもしれません。損失関数に関して一つ考察を述べておこうと思います。まず、Anchorと正例の間のコサイン類似度を大きくするように学習する点は、色の配置に関する不変性を学習させていることに相当します(permutation invariance)。つまり色を表すタイルの配置に意味はない、という点を明示的に損失として与えています。一方、Anchorと負例の間のコサイン類似度を小さくする損失は異なるソースからでたデータをが特徴空間上で異なるような制約になっていますが、この制約は例えば色の比率やコントラストなどに関して明示的には制約をかけていないため、ひょっとすると平均色の違いを学習しているだけになっている可能性もあります。このようなことを考えると以下のような改善法があり得るかもしれません。\n","\n","* 損失関数の変更\n","\n","今回は単純にコサイン類似度のみを用いていますが、この部分に関してどのあたりに注目して欲しいかという気持ちを込めて変更できるといいかもしれません。\n","\n","* Data Augmentationの適用\n","\n","今回は正例としてAnchorと配置が違うだけの画像、負例としてAnchorと異なる画像を用いていますが、例えば負例としてAnchorの画像の色に関して変動を加えた画像を用いる、なども考えられます。\n","\n","さらに、今回はあえて画像の入力として2D CNNを適用してみましたが、そもそも色の比率のみが問題とすると実は1D(色の3ch分を数えると2D)の点列として考えて同じような学習を行う、なども改善案としてはあります。この場合には2DCNNではなく、1DCNNやTransformerなどを用いることが考えられます。\n","\n","いずれにせよ今回の実験はかなり改善の余地があるため、興味ドリブンでやってみたよ、くらいのノリだと思ってください。"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M0DswFjTjZf-"},"source":["##
